# MemeMaker
This website will provide the public with a free tool to edit and incorporate funny memes with hilarious captions of their choosing. With much user input to edit the text, and the styling of the webpage, I aim to make this website user friendly. The best tool to make this possible will be the imgflip api, which grants me the chance to send requests to meme images, and with my free account let people create memes without needing to photoshop.
